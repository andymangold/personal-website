    title: "A Life Well Wasted"
    creator: "Robert Ashley"
    description: "A beautifully produced very occasional show about video games and the culture surrounding them. It captures the human interest of an emergent art form and mixes storytelling and journalism with music written and produced by the host. As a bonus, each episode is embodied into a poster designed by Olly Moss."

    title: "You Look Nice Today"
    creator: "Merlin Mann, Scott Simpson, and Adam Lisagor"
    description: "You Look Nice Today, a 'journal of emotional hygiene' is a show that never explains itself. Each episode drops the listener in media res with only the occasional prerecorded interstitials of John Hodgman reading single lines of pseudo found poetry to break up the conversation between the three friends. The show moves freely between 'normal' conversation and improvisational brainstorming of products and solutions for some unnamed entity, or the show itself, under the guise of a business. The show is edited in a unique and subtle way that skirts on surrealism, sometimes making the listener certain they have missed something, in a good way."
