’Tis the season for every columnist and blogger, in true [Oprahian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah's_Favorite_Things) fashion, to carefully curate a list of their favorite things to buy for others this holiday season. I’ve long felt like a foil to these merry, gaudy-sweater-clad elves of consumerism, so I thought I would contribute my two cents and urge people to be as thoughtful as possible in their giving this year.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve truly disliked gifts, both giving and receiving. Yes, I’m a scrooge of sorts. This is not because I don’t like ‘things’; I’m not some immaterial evangelist. Quite the contrary, I *love* things. I have a deep respect for thoughtfully designed, mindfully constructed products and the emotional role they play in our lives. I believe objects can have just as much cultural and artistic weight as a great film or a classic novel. It is because I love things so deeply that I so detest the brand of gift-giving that dominates the holiday season. It is a disservice to ourselves and others and a poignant example of how frivolous and wasteful we have become.

My guide is not a list of products, but rather some thoughts to help you give meaningful, or at least inoffensive, gifts to all those names on your list this year.

1. __Give gifts that are more useful than they are burdensome.__
Every gift, no matter how perfect, comes with a responsibility. Do not underestimate or forget this burden. By giving something to someone, you are asking them to care for it, store it in their home, clean it, maintain it, charge it, and take it with them when they move. The things in our lives consume our space, our time, and our emotional capital. For this reason, weigh a gift’s usefulness against its cost, not in dollars, but in encumbrance. Is the recipient still going to love the gift in two years when they’re packing it into a box to lug to their new apartment? If not, does he or she really love it now?

2. __Give humble gifts of excellent quality and design.__
Any gift should be measured by the same standards we use for all the objects in our lives. They should perform some useful task, demonstrate thoughtful design, and be built to withstand the test of time. They should be the best solutions to real, everyday problems. The *best* solutions. Often times, such items are expensive, so keep your gifts modest. It is far better to give someone the best bottle-opener on earth, one that will last a lifetime and can be handed down through generations, than a more complicated appliance of lesser quality. A foolish person may feel cheated by a humble gift, but time will prove it to be thoughtful beyond their initial comprehension.

3. __Be mindful of the origins of your gift.__
Every time we buy a thing, for ourselves or others, we are casting a vote for the companies and infrastructures that have brought that product into the world. Buying locally manufactured items supports local economies, buying mass-produced items supports mass production. In our capitalist society, these monetary ‘votes’ decide which things flourish and which things flounder. Buying a gift for someone is, for all intents and purposes, casting a vote on their behalf, a responsibility which you should not take lightly. Take this opportunity to support independent craftspeople, local businesses, and sustainable products. Inform the recipient about where the product came from, even if he or she isn’t usually concerned about such issues.

4. __Give used gifts whenever possible.__
The world is already full of wonderful things. With the notable exception of technology, you can find a better, more unique, and more affordable version of just about anything you would buy new on websites like [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) and [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/). It will require more effort on your part to find what you’re looking for and plan ahead for slower shipping speeds, but that effort is as much a part of the gift as the physical product is. If you’re not willing to spend an hour or two finding a suitable gift, how can you expect the recipient to spend the rest of their life living with it?

5. __Carefully consider why the recipient doesn’t already own the thing you’re giving him or her.__
The best case scenario is that you’ve found the perfect gift and the person you’re planning on giving it to doesn't even know it exists. However, thanks to the Internet, this is becoming extremely unlikely. Perhaps it is something indulgent, that the person would love, but never buy for themselves. Or maybe it is some expendable commodity such as food or film for a camera. If you can’t figure it out, more likely than not it is simply something that the person does not want and therefore chose not to buy.

6. __Share a piece of art you love as a gift.__
Instead of trying to guess what the recipient might like, share *your* favorite album, book, or film with them. Give them their own copy, and include a note telling them why it’s meaningful to you. These gifts are about content and experience, so their physical manifestations are less of a burden. Once a book has been read or an album has been listened to, they can be disposed of or re-gifted without guilt.

It is far worse to have shitty things taking up space in our homes and minds than nothing at all. Please remember this when buying gifts for those you care about this year. If you’re lucky enough to be able to afford to give and receive gifts, don’t waste that prosperity by trafficking in cheap, mass-produced garbage. When in doubt, I always recommend donations to appropriate non-profits in lieu of physical gifts, especially for those gifts that you’re socially obligated to give, but don't actually care about.
